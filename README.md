# Risk of Rain 2 Mod - Patapon Meditate

Alters Seeker's Meditate quick-time-event minigame to be Patapon-themed. It does not change the overall functionality of the Meditate skill.

This mod includes:
- Perfect beat mechanic (Pressing each input around 0.5 seconds after the previous is considered a "perfect" input).
- Optional damage increase for the meditation explosion if all inputs were perfect. (Can be toggled from the config file or with Risk of Options), disabled by default.
- Drum sounds, including perfect inputs and mistimed inputs, and animated visuals.
