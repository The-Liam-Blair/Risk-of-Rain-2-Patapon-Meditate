# Risk of Rain 2 Mod - Patapon Meditation

Alters the Seeker's Meditation UI to be Patapon-themed.

This mod includes:
- Perfect beat mechanic (0.5 seconds per input for it to be considered a "perfect" input).
- Optional damage increase for the meditation explosion if all inputs were perfect. (Can be toggled with the config file or with Risk of Options).
- Drum sounds, including perfect and imperfect inputs, and animated visuals.
